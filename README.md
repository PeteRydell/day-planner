The Work Day Scheduler application allows users to input, save and track hourly tasks or calendar events.

By using Moment.js, the calendar dynamically changes day and time as well as displays the current date:

The schedule is also color coded based on the time of day, reflecting past, current and upcoming blocks with grey, red and green highlighting:

The user is able to input text into any of the blocks (9am-5pm) and save to local storage using the teal save buttons on the right:

Upon saving, inputs are stored locally and will remain in the blocks until deleted.
